This leaked phone conversation between EU foreign policy chief Cathy Ashton and Estonia's foreign minister Urmas Paet reveals that the snipers in Ukraine that fired on protesters were actually from the new coalition government, and Western diplomats knew. For your convenience we've uploaded a short version that skips to the important part, and the full version which has the conversation from the very beginning.

<h3>The short version:</h3>

<div class="video_wrapper_outer"><iframe width="100%" height="100" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/138112694&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></div>

<blockquote>Urmas Paet: "All the evidence shows that the people who were killed by snipers from both sides, among police men and people in the street, that they were the same snipers killing people from both sides."<br/>
Cathy Ashton: "Well that's, yeah..."<br/>
Urmas Paet: "And she also showed me some photos and she said that has medical doctor, she can say that it is the same handwriting..."<br/>
Cathy Ashton: "Yeah..."<br/>
Urmas Paet: "Same type of bullets... and it's really disturbing that now the new coalition, that they don't want to investigate what exactly happened. So that there is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind the snipers, it was not Yanukovich, but it was somebody from the new coalition."</blockquote>

This isn't really surprising since we know that the <a href="Washington's Role in the Ukrainian Coup & How it May Spin Out of Control">U.S. government met several times with known Neo-Nazi leaders in Ukraine before the coup</a>, and that these <a href="http://stormcloudsgathering.com/videos-from-ukraine-that-the-us-media-will-never-show-you">Neo-Nazi groups have been caught on video committing numerous acts of brutality during and after the protests.</a>
