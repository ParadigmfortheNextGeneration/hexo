I'm going to show you some footage of the Charlie Hebdo shootings which has been restricted or taken down from a number of websites. As you will see it contains no blood, gore or graphic violence. It does however punch a major hole in the official story.

You can draw your own conclusions.

The following clip was played on France 24. You'll notice in the middle that a section is edited out.

Let's look at the clip that was edited out.

Now if we zoom in and slow it down you'll see that the officer isn't actually hit by a bullet. There is a blast that hits the sidewalk just in front of him, but he is clearly not hit in the head as the corporate media <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ahmed-merabet-the-muslim-police-officer-killed-in-charlie-hebdo-shooting-2015-1">is claiming</a>.

Let's watch it again. Notice that the head isn't rocked by the blast as it would be if he was actually hit. Notice the plume of dust about a foot in front of him as the shot hits the ground.  This is a AK-47. A hit to the head would splatter blood and brains all over the sidewalk.

<strong>UPDATE Feb 5th: To address those who have claimed that a 7.62 round can go through a human head without leaving blood, without making the head recoil, and without splattering brains on the sidewalk, I have decided to get ruthless. Go look at the pictures on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.friendsoftibet.org/main/execution.html">this page</a> if you have the guts (warning it's a real execution with an AK at close range). </strong>

Anyone who claims that this footage shows someone being hit in the head by a 7.62Ã—39mm round either has no experience with guns, or is lying. This is a big bullet that does massive damage and makes a bloody mess. This officer was NOT killed by a gunshot to the head.

My first thought here was "ok, they missed". Just one problem. Every single mainstream media outlet is claiming that he was finished off with a shot to the head, and that's blatantly false.

So then you have to ask, what else are they lying about? 

Funny thing is, these guys went to the trouble to put on ski masks, but for some reason, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/08/europe/charlie-hebdo-paris-shooting/">according to the authorities</a>, they decided<a rel="nofollow" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/08/europe/charlie-hebdo-paris-shooting/"> to leave their identity cards laying in the get away car</a>. That's how the perpetrators were identified. Really? Come on.

The other funny thing, the suspects wound up dead, so case closed.

Now I'm not going to claim to know what really happened here, but we are being lied to, and lies like this mean trouble is coming.
