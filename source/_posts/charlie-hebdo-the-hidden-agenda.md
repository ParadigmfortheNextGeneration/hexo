Whatever you believe actually happened in Paris, one thing is very clear: the powers that be are going to try to use this event to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/french-defense-minister-isis-must-be-wiped-out-2015-1">expand wars,</a> intensify <a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.yahoo.com/anti-terror-cooperation-internet-firms-essential-ministers-130742612.html">domestic surveillance</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/france-s-elite-counterterrorism-forces-prepare-for-the-worst-1.2898280">legislate away more of our rights.</a> 

This is not speculation. They have already started in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/france-pushes-for-tighter-online-surveillance-1421186711">France</a>, in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/13/uk-ban-secure-communications/">U.K.</a> (see <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228824/8359.pdf">this document</a>), at the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://itar-tass.com/en/world/770711">E.U. level</a>, in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/republicans-on-capitol-hill-paris-shooting-shows-congress-can-t-hamstring-nsa-20150107">United States</a> and they are going to attempt to push this on a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/01/white-house-sets-delayed-antiextremism-conference-200891.html">global scale</a> (also see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/16/us/politics/report-finds-no-alternative-to-bulk-collection-of-phone-data.html">this</a>). All nicely coordinated to ride the wave of outrage that followed the attacks.

If you want a glimpse at just how far they want to take this, look at France. They're already <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/toulouse-un-homme-condamne-a-trois-mois-ferme-pour-apologie-d-acte-terroriste-12-01-2015-4440511.php">dealing out serious prison sentences</a> for those caught saying anything that could be interpreted as supporting terrorism. Does questioning the official story count as supporting terrorism? Where do you draw the line? Who decides?

Oh, so you don't actually have to support terrorism. Just disagreeing is enough. 

Humanity, do you really want to learn this lesson the hard way, again? 

They are playing you people: Problem, Reaction, Solution. It's the oldest trick in the book.

With so much riding on this story, obviously there are those who have a vested interest in preventing evidence which contradicts the official narrative from reaching the public. 

On January 10th we uploaded a video entitled "Charlie Hebdo Shootings - Censored Video". Within 24 hours it had over a million views. Then the video was age restricted and removed from listings in spite of the fact that it depicted no blood, no gore, no graphic violence of any kind. It did, however, challenge the official narrative of the event. In spite of being age restricted the video continued to grow and added another million views.

We uploaded a French translation of this same video on January 12th. Within one day, the French version was taken down completely. Not age restricted, not blocked in some countries, completely deleted from the site. Again, this video showed no blood or gore whatsoever. In fact it didn't even show actual murder.

We're not going to show that footage again here. We're not going to give them any excuse to block this video. However if you enter the following url into your browser (http://stormcloudsgathering.com/charlie-hebdo-cover-up) you will find a download link to the original files. Watch it and come to your own conclusions.

Of course, there is much more at stake here than our little video, or even the attacks themselves. The internet as a whole poses a threat to the ruling class, because in its current form ideas cannot be fully controlled. The internet in its current form makes it very hard for them to hide their corruption, their wars of aggression, and their covert operations, and that makes it hard to govern. They intend to change that (for your security of course).

Funny isn't it, 17 people people get killed in France, supposedly over a question of free speech, and the first thing that governments of the world want to do is use that event to take away free speech on the internet. 

It's also funny that these same governments expressed no outrage whatsoever as the United States military killed hundreds of thousands of civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere. 

Apparently it's not murder if you use a drone or a guided missile. Apparently it's not terrorism if women and children are killed by soldiers and government bureaucrats. No, it's only murder when politicians and the corporate media tell you it's murder, and if they get their way, they'll be able to take down any website, video or social media account that dares contradict them. 

There's one question on many of your minds right now. What can we do? How can we fight back? 

Well, first of all, stop waiting for instructions. Do what you can. Use the talent you have. Get creative. Remember necessity is the mother of invention. If each and every one of you just did what you could without worrying about whether or not you would succeed, that  would be enough.

And remember, these politicians don't have any real power. They just have your obedience. Even their enforcement arms, the police and the military, are really just structured obedience.

Withdraw that obedience and it's game over.

Nothing should be off limits to the NSA or the GCHQ. In other words privacy would be made illegal.
