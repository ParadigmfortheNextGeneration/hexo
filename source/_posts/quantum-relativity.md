As humans we've all been conditioned to view three dimensional space as absolute, time as a single, linear progression, and our experiences as reality itself. Such conditioning obviously serves a purpose in in day to day life, but when one seeks to understand the true nature of reality and our place within it, these assumptions become obstacles.

This is why modern scientists have had such a difficult time combining quantum physics and general relativity into a unified theory. They actually already have the facts needed to connect the dots, but connecting those dots requires a paradigm shift, that many are uncomfortable with.

<strong>The problem isn't what you don't know. The problem is what you think you know that just isn't so.</strong>

The confusion begins with the way most people think of quanta. If you ask the average college student what an electron is, they will probably tell you that it is a particle, which evokes an image of a tiny object floating in space. This is a misconception. Quanta are not objects.

Quanta have what scientist call a wave/particle duality. Meaning that they can behave as either a particle or a wave depending on how we interact with them. The terms wave and particle however, are deceptive. A more accurate way of conceptualizing quanta would be to think of their wave state as a field of probability which can be recorded as an interference pattern, and their particle state as probability collapsed into single point of interaction. For more on this look up the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/new-analysis-rescues-quantum-wave-particle-duality">double slit experiment.</a>

Now, even those who are aware of the bizarre properties of quanta, such as their wave/particle duality, quantum teleportation, quantum super positioning and quantum entanglement, still tend to conceptualize this phenomena within mental framework based on space and time. 

Again, this is just conditioning.

Quanta do not exist within time and space. They do not occupy three dimensional positions. In fact time and space are actually created by the interactions of quanta, specifically quantum entanglement. This phenomenon is described in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler%E2%80%93DeWitt_equation">Wheeler DeWitt equation</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/quantum-experiment-shows-how-time-emerges-from-entanglement-d5d3dc850933">has been confirmed experimentally.</a> Also see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24473-entangled-toy-universe-shows-time-may-be-an-illusion.html#.VMhN3sZ21kE">this.</a>

Interestingly general relativity theorists and cosmologists are thrown off by the same underlying assumptions.

They acknowledge that the origin of the universe (the singularity) is a timeless, spaceless (nonlocal) state, but most don't fully recognize the implications.

For example: you can't say that the singularity existed "before" the big bang. That's putting the timeless inside of time. If something is timeless then it has no temporal relationships. It cannot be before or after anything.

Now general relativity tells us that that time and space are one fabric. This is not merely theoretical. GPS satellites have to account for distortions in time caused by their speed, otherwise their readings would drift by several miles.

Since time and space are one fabric, without space, you cannot have time and without time you cannot have space.

If you connect the dots here, quanta actually share several key characteristics with the singularity. They are both timeless and spaceless energy. 

Now if quanta and the singularity are both timeless and spaceless, then they cannot be separate. Separation can only exist within a time space continuum. If quanta and the singularity are not separate, then they are actually one.

And here we arrive at the crux of the matter. The singularity didn't cease to exist in an explosion billions of years ago. Quanta are the singularity interacting with itself. Everything is one. Literally. This is quantum relativity.

{There is no getting outside of this quantum singularity. There is no before or after it. The quantum singularity can only exist in a state of here and now.}

Now some of the more advanced among you might ask "But what about gravity?"

Well, general relativity tells us that gravity is a geometric property of space and time, and again experimental evidence shows that space and time are byproducts of quantum entanglement. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/20130917-a-jewel-at-the-heart-of-quantum-physics/">Scientist have recently discovered</a> that certain geometric models can be used to dramatically simplify calculations of quantum interactions, and quantum entanglement (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/physics/theoretical-physics-and-mathematical-physics/geometry-quantum-states-introduction-quantum-entanglement">Geometry of Quantum States</a>), so it is not a massive leap to consider that the geometry that creates gravity is actually a characteristic of quantum probability fields. In fact some researchers are actively exploring this possibility.

So how does all this relate to us in this human experience we are having? 

We still have to deal with the "real world" with its time clocks, bills, wars, and petty tyrants, right?

Well, this rabbit hole actually goes much, much deeper, but if you want to take something home from this level start here: the rules of the game are not as rigid as you've been taught that they are.

If you start with our quantum nature as your point of reference, everything changes. The very idea that we owe obedience to these pitiful phantoms that we call government, or that we are bound to keep spinning these bizarre hamster wheels we've built for ourselves, becomes laughable.

It doesn't have to be this way. Choose something different.

Find that millimeter of free will within, and expand it. As you do, you'll start to realize that reality is a creative process, not a mechanical, linear, progression.

You are the quantum singularity interacting with itself. The more we wake up to that the wider the possibilities become.
