Tell me, tell me what you're looking for when you ride your war machines...<br />
and tell me what you think you'll find when it's finally said and done.<br />
I've seen the road, the road you're on...<br />
won't you look at what I see?

Cause I see the point of no return just ahead.

I'm in a crowd that's rushing for the edge...<br />
and the earth is bleeding at our feet...<br />
and with pain in my heart I'm screaming out to you...<br />
won't you look at what I see?

Cause I see the point of no return just ahead.

And what will you do...<br />
for the seven generations still to come?<br />
What will you say, and what will you do?<br />
For the love of the earth turn around...<br />
Cause none of us are leaving here alive.<br />
What will you say? What will you say,<br />
and what will you do?

I'm calling out to you! Won't you turn around.
