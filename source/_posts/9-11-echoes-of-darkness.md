Some events echo through the pages of history causing ripples decades or even centuries later. These secondary consequences sometimes are sometimes a direct result of the events themselves, but more often than not they are driven by our perception, the mythology that we build around those events.

The narrative of 911 defined the past decade. It was used to justify the Patriot Act, the indefinite detention provisions in the NDAA of 2012 and 2013 and it was used to take America to war against Afghanistan then Iraq.

 Some events echo through the pages of history causing ripples decades or even centuries later. These secondary consequences sometimes are sometimes a direct result of the events themselves, but more often than not they are driven by our perception, the mythology that we build around those events.

The narrative of 911 defined the past decade. It was used to justify the Patriot Act, the indefinite detention provisions in the NDAA of 2012 and 2013 and it was used to take America to war against Afghanistan then Iraq. Four thousand Americans may have died on that day, but well over a million civilians died based on the STORY of what happened. Of course the fact that so much death and destruction was justified using that narrative makes it emotionally difficult for many Americans to reexamine it. After all, admitting that you were wrong when nothing is at stake is hard enough, but if the official story of 911 is wrong then this would mean that U.S. government killed all those civilians and shredded your the constitution based on a lie, and some of you were cheering them on.

When people NEED to believe something, the facts matter very little. Reality can be bent and twisted into any shape needed, information discarded, and contradictions ignored. Never underestimate people's willingness to delude themselves.

In America, where the need to believe is most entrenched, you'll rarely see  September 11th addressed without some people resorting to third grader level name calling. Tin foil hat conspiracy theorists, conspiritards, 911 nutters, I'm sure you've heard these. It's the lowest and least sophisticated flavor of logical fallacy, the ad hominem, but it works when you're dealing with people who operate on third grade level. 
 
What's most hilarious about this attempt to stigmatize those who dare question the official story is the fact that the fact that many of the actual members of the 911 commission have spoken out to to say that the investigation was a sham. 

But of course it doesn't matter if the people who actually ran the investigation say it was a scam, you're supposed to believe the official story, if you don't you're crazy, unhinged and maybe even a bit dangerous.

Listen, I know you don't anyone to think you're crazy, but let's just take a look at a little bit of the evidence, just between me and you. I won't tell anyone I promise. Now this isn't a two hour documentary so we don't have time to cover everything. Instead we'll just confront a few obvious, smoking guns.

Smoking gun #1: The collapse of the World Trade Center building 7. Three buildings collapsed in New York on that day, two were hit by planes, Building 7 was not hit by a plane. No one claims that it was, yet at 5:20 pm on September 11th it collapsed into it's own footprint. It went straight down at free fall speed. At first NIST tried to deny this and placed it's computer models over the actual video evidence, but in their final report they do in fact admit that the building fell at free fall. Why is this significant? Because in order to fall at free fall speed the structural supports would have had to have been destroyed with carefully timed explosives.

(The use of explosives was corroborated by the eyewitness account of Barry Jennings who survived the WT7 collapse.)

Funny thing is, in spite of the fact that never in history had a steel frame building collapsed due to an office fire a lot of people knew the building was going to collapse before it came down. 

We have CNN reporting the collapse an hour before it came down.

We also   have the BBC who reported the collapse even though the building was still visible in the background.

And we have footage of people on the street warning the building was about to collapse. How did they know that this was going to happen when it isn't even physically possible for an ordinary office fire to bend or melt steel? I makes about as much sense as a farmer suddenly warning you that his pig is about to levitate.

And this brings us to smoking gun #2: Explosions in the basements in the twin towers and on the lower floors of building 7.


This of course brings us to smoking gun #3: Molten steel found in the basements of the buildings after the collapse. 

 
By the way it wasn't just WTC 7 that went down like a controlled demolition, all three of the buildings that collapsed in New York that day came down at free fall speed. The thousands of steel and concrete beams which should have resisted such a collapse were blown apart as the building was falling. 

Over 1700 licensed architects and engineers have gone on record to say that the official 911 story is physically impossible. It would have required carefully placed explosives to take out the support beams, and guess what? The dust from the ruins of the towers has been independently tested and shown to contain large quantities of military grade nano-thermite. The results of these tests were peer reviewed and published in the The Open Chemical Physics Journal in 2009. However the agency behind the official investigation NIST, has refused from the very beginning to test for any accelerants or explosives in the dust. This in spite of the fact that such testing is explicitly called for in fire investigation standards for events involving this kind of damage.

We're not even scratching the surface here. No matter what part of the of the official story you look at there are glaring holes that require magical thinking explain away. You were lied to, pure and simple, and a lot of people were killed based on that lie. I know that's uncomfortable to look at, but it's the truth.

Why are we talking about this now, 12 years after the fact? First of all because the war on terror is still underway. There are people being killed right now because of this lie and the federal government is grabbing more and more dictatorial power to supposedly protect you.

Furthermore, those who control the U.S. government are trying to find a way to take America to war with Syria, a war which will draw in Iran, Russia and China; World War 3. But the American people aren't going for it. They aren't buying propaganda. So to convince the people to back this war they are going to have to do something big, something that makes 911 pale in comparison. 

This is just how they operate. Problem, Reaction, Solution is pretty much the only tool they have at their disposal. Originality is not their forte.

The stigma surrounding 911 research and the juvenile way that the uninformed attempt to cower those who speak out into silence is more than just an obstacle to truth. As long as the powers that be think they can get away with this kind of thing and as long as you keep accepting their ridiculous stories at face value, they'll keep doing it. Waking up isn't a matter of personal preference, it's a question of life and death.
