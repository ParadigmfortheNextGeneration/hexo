 Fluoride, or Hydrofluorosilic acid (H 2 SiF 6 ), is not naturally occurring but is a waste by-product derived from the industrial manufacture of aluminium, zinc, uranium, aerosols, insecticides, fertilizers, plastics, lubricants and pharmaceuticals. It is also a Part II Poison under the UK Poisons Act 1972 ranking in toxicity above lead and just below arsenic.
 
Fluoride is one of the basic ingredients in both PROZAC (Fluoxetene Hydrochloride) and Sarin nerve gas (Isopropyl-Methyl-Phosphoryl Fluoride). American toothpastes containing fluoride are by law obliged to state, "WARNING: Keep out of reach of children under 6 years of age. If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional help or contact a poison control center immediately."
