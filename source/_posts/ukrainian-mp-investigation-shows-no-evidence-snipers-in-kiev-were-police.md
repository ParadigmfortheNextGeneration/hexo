Ukrainian M.P. Gennady Moskal, has a history of criticizing the Berkut police force. In fact, in December of 2013 he referred to them as an <a rel="nofollow" href="http://kiev1.org/en/gennadij-moskal-berkut.html">"illegal paramilitary formation".</a> So when he came forward this week to announce that the provisional government's investigation into the shooting found <a href="http://en.itar-tass.com/world/731428">no evidence that the Berkut police were the ones that fired on the protesters in Kiev in February</a> that's significant. 

Of course if you have followed this drama closely these results shouldn't be surprising at all. They merely confirm the statements made by EU foreign policy chief Cathy Ashton and Estonia's foreign minister Urmas Paet  in the leaked phone call discussing the shootings.

<h3>The short version:</h3>

<div class="video_wrapper_outer"><iframe width="100%" height="100" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/138112694&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></div>

<blockquote>Urmas Paet: "All the evidence shows that the people who were killed by snipers from both sides, among police men and people in the street, that they were the same snipers killing people from both sides."<br/>
Cathy Ashton: "Well that's, yeah..."<br/>
Urmas Paet: "And she also showed me some photos and she said that has medical doctor, she can say that it is the same handwriting..."<br/>
Cathy Ashton: "Yeah..."<br/>
Urmas Paet: "Same type of bullets... and it's really disturbing that now the new coalition, that they don't want to investigate what exactly happened. So that there is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind the snipers, it was not Yanukovich, but it was somebody from the new coalition." 
(Note: Urmas Paet is not a native English speaker, so his wording is a bit odd at points. This transcript doesn't correct his errors. )</blockquote>

<h3>The long version:</h3>

<div class="video_wrapper_outer"><iframe width="100%" height="100" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/138112414&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></div>

It is surprising, however, that Gennady Moskal was honest enough to release those results. I would be watching him closely from here on out.

So now let's review the democracy score card in Ukraine. The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://stormcloudsgathering.com/the-ukraine-crisis-what-youre-not-being-told">U.S. backs the coup toppling Yanukovich</a>, riding the outrage over sniper shootings that it turns out weren't committed by the Ukrainian police at all. The provisional government takes power and subsequently orders the military to crush uprisings in the east three times, then allows <a href="http://stormcloudsgathering.com/the-odessa-massacre-what-really-happened">Neo-Nazi thugs to brutally murder protesters in Odessa.</a> Furthermore, if you pay attention to what Urmas Paet said in the leaked call, the evidence he saw showed that it was likely someone in the provisional government behind the sniper shootings in Kiev.

But will you hear about this on the evening news? Of course not. The U.S. government and the corporate media are only outraged when it's politically expedient.
