In this video we're going to provide you with compelling evidence that the crimes against humanity committed in Kiev earlier this year were in fact committed by the new coalition government and that officials in the E.U. and the United States knew full well who committed these crimes and that they are protecting and financially supporting the real criminals.

On February 20th of 2013 the world was shocked by video footage of snipers firing on protesters in Kiev Ukraine. Twenty one people were murdered, and it was widely assumed that President Victor Yanukovich and his supporters were behind the attacks. However a phone conversation between EU foreign policy chief Cathy Ashton and Estonia's foreign minister Urmas Paet leaked to the public on March 5th reveals that the snipers in were actually from the new coalition government, and that Western diplomats knew this and covered it up.

<h3>The short version of the leaked call:</h3>

<div class="video_wrapper_outer"><iframe width="100%" height="100" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/138112694&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></div>

<blockquote>Urmas Paet: "All the evidence shows that the people who were killed by snipers from both sides, among police men and people in the street, that they were the same snipers killing people from both sides."<br/>
Cathy Ashton: "Well that's, yeah..."<br/>
Urmas Paet: "And she also showed me some photos and she said that has medical doctor, she can say that it is the same handwriting..."<br/>
Cathy Ashton: "Yeah..."<br/>
Urmas Paet: "Same type of bullets... and it's really disturbing that now the new coalition, that they don't want to investigate what exactly happened. So that there is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind the snipers, it was not Yanukovich, but it was somebody from the new coalition." </blockquote>

<h3>The long version of the leaked call:</h3>

<div class="video_wrapper_outer"><iframe width="100%" height="100" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/138112414&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></div>

For some reason the U.S. media didn't think that little detail was worth covering. 

But waitâ€¦ I thought the opposition were peaceful activists who just wanted a chance to join the European Union.

Well yeah, that's the official narrative that the U.S. media outlets are peddling, but real story is much more ominous. It turns out that the most powerful and influential contingent in the opposition is a coalition of literal fascists and Neo-Nazis, and they aren't peaceful. In fact they are extremely brutal.

The most prominent among these groups is an organization called Svoboda. The Svoboda party which traces its roots to the Ukrainian partisan army of World War II, was loosely allied with Nazi Germany. Until 2004, Svoboda had been called the Social-Nationalist Party, a deliberate reference to the National Socialism of the Nazis.

We're not throwing the term Neo-Nazi around as an empty slur here. The leader of Svoboda, Oleh Tyahnybok, has openly targeted Jews and ethnic Russians in Ukraine for many years. In 2004 he was kicked out of Viktor Yushenko's government  for a speech calling for Ukrainians to fight against a "Muscovite-Jewish mafia", and in 2005 he signed his name to an open letter to the leadership of Ukraine entitled "Stop the Criminal Activities of Organised Jewry". 

And none of this was a secret. The BBC was already reporting on the danger that Svoboda's rise posed back in 2012, and the EU passed a resolution that same year condemning Svoboda, as "racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic". Yet somehow the U.S. government thought it was appropriate to back these extremists.

This is a picture of Victoria Nuland from the U.S. State Department meeting with Oleh Tyahnybok in February, and this is a picture of Senator John McCain sharing a stage with Tyahnybok in December.

Why would the U.S. government work with Neo-Nazis? 

Because they thought they could control the situation. They thought they could install their puppets behind the scenes and manipulate the situation in their favor. This isn't a theory. That same Victoria Nulland who met with Svoboda in February was caught in another leaked phone call discussing who would they would put in power.

The mainstream media tried to draw your attention away from the important part of this conversation by focusing on the fact that she used a cuss word when referring to the E.U.
The U.S. government thought they could control this beast. But they were wrong. Svoboda and the Right Sektor are not toys to be played with. These groups are armed, they're forceful, and they view this crisis as an opportunity to reshape Ukraine in their own image.

This video shows a prominent leader from the Right Sektor, Alexander Muzychko, brandishing an Ak-47 in parliament letting them know who is in charge.

This is the same Alexander Muzychko who publicly vowed to fight "against Jews communists, and Russian scum" for as long as he lives.

Apparently the U.S. government has been a little slow to catch on to the fact that their hand has been exposed. In March a senior U.S. official told Reuters that "Since entering the Ukrainian Parliament in October 2012, the Svoboda leadership has been working to take their party in a more moderate direction and to become a modern, European mainstream political party, The leadership has been much more vigilant about expelling or otherwise punishing individual members who engage in xenophobic behavior or rhetoric."

So it's ok to use known Neo-Nazi groups to topple a government as long as their leaders keep their people from saying anything stupid in front of cameras for a few months?  The reality of the matter is that as ridiculous as this assertion makes Washington look, they are trapped. They can't deny that Svoboda and the Right Sektor are running the coalition government when Svoboda holds five senior posts including the deputy prime minister position and the Right Sektor's Dmytro Yarosh is now the country's Deputy Secretary of National Security.

But what about that dramatic video  "I am a Ukrainian" that went viral as this crisis was unfolding. It was so compelling, so heart wrenching. Yeah, but who made it? Did you notice the link in the description? Awhispertoaroar... who are these people? Oh look, a link in the description. Let's click it. They have a website and a behind the scenes section. Oh it list the film makers. Who's this here? Larry Diamond, inspiration and executive producer. He's also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Endowment for Democracy and an advisor for the U.S. State Department. You know the funny thing about the National Endowment for <strike>Regime Change</strike> Democracy is that even though they call themselves an NGO they get virtually all of it's money from the U.S. federal government. You can verify this by downloading their annual financial disclosures. I'm sure it's just a coincidence that the NED has been pouring massive amounts of money into Ukraine to "strengthen democracy and civil society"?

That sound nice doesn't it? Democracy... civil society. Of course by now you've realized that when they talk about spreading democracy what they really mean is regime change, and they are willing to work with the most despicable elements when it's expedient.

It's exactly the same game they played in Syria. The U.S. government funded known extremists, literal terrorist organizations who have been documented massacring whole towns. They gave them money, they gave them weapons, and even after those extremists used sarin gas on thousands of civilians and got caught by the U.N., Washington still covered for them. Even to this day they are still funding those murderers, they are still training them, and they are still sending them weapons. There's a word for this kind of activity: state backed terrorism.

But the situation in Ukraine didn't unfold as planned. The parliament of Crimea, in the South of Ukraine voted to secede, and they are putting the decision up for a public referendum. The U.S. claims that this referendum is "unconstitutional" and says they won't recognize Crimea's decision as legitimate regardless of the outcome. So a foreign backed Neo-Nazi coup is constitutional, but a declaration of independence placed to a general vote is not? Seriously? That's the best you guys can do? Who writes these scripts?

Take a step back and look at the pattern.

The real stakes of this drama are much bigger than Ukraine or Syria and these are not random and isolated events. We are witnessing the final stages of a geopolitical chess game that is designed to end in war. But in order to succeed they need to convince you, the public, that they didn't see this coming. They need you to believe that the other side was the aggressor. They are counting on you not paying attention to the fact that Obama signed an order targeting Russia with sanctions this past week and revoking the visas of a number of Russian diplomats. They are counting on you not noticing that Russia had warned that such a move would result in Russia dropping the dollar and encouraging others to do so as well. They're counting on you being too naive to realize that economic warfare invites physical warfare. They think you're too stupid to connect the dots.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Prove them wrong.</h2>
