Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. This is concept was established by Einsteins equation E = Mc2 and has been confirmed by numerous experiments. Therefore energy has always existed, and will always exist, this means that our current concept of time where everything has a beginning and and end is false. If we follow this line of reasoning it should be obvious that any scientific theory that describes the origins of the universe is not actually describing the origin of energy, but rather of one particular expression of that energy.

The big bang theory traces this universe to a timeless and motionless state called the singularity. Since the singularity is timeless it cannot be talked about as before or after anything. If something exists but is not before or after anything then it is now. Therefore the singularity is now.

Again energy can neither be created nor destroyed, therefore all of the energy in existence is present in the singularity.

Time and space are one fabric, you cannot have one without the other. This is a basic premise of modern physics. There is no time in the singularity, therefore there is no space in the singularity. Without space and time there can be no separation or individuation. Therefore energy cannot be separated from the singularity, it cannot be broken up or divided in any way. It is a unified, monolithic field, with no boundaries. This is the eternal and omnipresent root of the universe.

And yet the relative universe exists, separation and individuation exist. How do we reconcile this? How can two people sit down and have a conversation if they are both expressions of the same indivisible field of energy?

A good way to conceptualize this is to use the metaphor of a video game on your computer. The characters in the game are all running on the same hardware, their spacial separation is illusory, and their time based interactions are expressions of preexisting probabilities. It is the encoding of time that creates the possibility of interaction both in a video game and in the real world. In the video game that that code of time is stored with all the probabilities and possible outcomes coexisting on a disk, in the real world the code of time with all the probabilities and possible outcomes resides in the singularity. 

This does not imply a deterministic existence where our lives are predetermined and free choice is impossible. Such a concept operates from an erroneous view of causality. All probabilities, all possible outcomes coexist in one moment, but in each moment we choose from those probabilities and our lives are expressions of these choices. These choices aren't always rational or constructive, but this is due largely to a distorted view of who we are. If rather than viewing ourselves as strictly isolated individuals at odds with the outside world we viewed ourselves as part of a single unified field of existence, how might that change the way we interact?

How would we treat others if we understood that everything we do to them we are actually doing ourselves?

Think about it.
