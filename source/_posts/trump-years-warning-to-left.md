The results of the 2016 presidential election came as a shock to the political left.
To say that some are having a hard time coming to terms with the words "President Trump", and what the next 4 to 8 years will bring, would be an understatement.

Those who told you that a Trump presidency was impossible were quick to remix their pre-election narrative,
and position themselves as leaders of the new resistance. These pundits have made it clear that self reflection is off the table. This leaves them (and their audiences) utterly unprepared for what's coming.

Some of what you are about to hear is going to sting like rubbing alcohol on a dirty wound, but those of you who are mature enough to listen and to process your cognitive dissonance, will understand by the end that it's for your own good.
(You could think of it as tough love.)

And there are some of you listening right now that already get it. 
You operate outside the artificial left right paradigm.
You refuse to buy into ideological identities.
You stand for principles, not personalities.
You stood up during the Obama years.
You called him out.

You stand against war,
the expansion of the police state,
and debt based, banker controlled money.
You already hold the common ground.

This video is not about you.
This video is for you.

There is nothing more detrimental to the integrity of political activists and "journalists" than to have their party of choice in power. 

There is always a tendency to cover for their candidate, and to whitewash damaging stories. It starts small, but these micro-deceptions accumulate over time and eventually crystalize into delusional storylines. These storylines are much more palatable than the truth, and most don't have the discipline to fact-check when they're being told what they want to hear. So the lies proliferate and become entrenched. Anyone who counters the storyline is viewed as opposition, and is discredited, tuned out and pushed away. What's left is a nice comfortable bubble; an echo chamber. Like it or not, after 8 years of Obama, this is exactly where the left finds themselves.

If you think Hillary lost the election because of "fake news"...
you're gonna have a bad time.

It's not just a question of being out of touch. These delusional narratives have consequences. The anti-war movement shriveled during the Obama years. The left looked the other way as Libya was toppled, turning a country that once had the highest standard of living in all of Africa into cesspool of violence and extremism. The left was silent as money, weapons and training were channeled towards jihadists in Syria in a failed attempt to topple Assad. This led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands and unleashed a flood of refugees. And when Putin pushed back the left normalized anti-Russian saber-rattling and propaganda, even as the Obama administration took us to the brink of third world war.

With Trump in the Whitehouse you're going to see a lot of people putting on their activist pants again, but most of these characters will be ridiculed or ignored by those who they actually need to influence. Credibility has been lost.
The path back to credibility must begin with an honest accounting of the crimes committed by the Obama administration. If you try to protect his legacy, you will be viewed as a hypocrite and fool.

Many on the left consider Trump to be something of a Hitler 2.0 and have issued calls to stand up to the rise of fascism. 
Such calls would be a bit more credible had you stood up to Obama when he expanded the NSA's domestic surveillance program, legalized indefinite detention without trial under the NDAA, claimed the right to unilaterally execute anyone on his presidential kill list, jailed whistleblowers at a record pace, renewed the Patriot Act twice, and militarized the police nationwide.

Yes, these abuses began under Bush, but Obama had the power to roll them back, and he didn't. In fact he took them even farther, and the left refused to hold him accountable. By covering for your man you literally gave Trump all the tools of a full fledged military dictatorship. He won't have to dismantle any constitutional protections. **They don't exist anymore, and the left has no one to blame but themselves.**

What? You didn't think the political pendulum would ever swing the other way? You thought your team would stay in power forever? The fact that you didn't see this coming is not an excuse. This was an ethical lapse of epic proportions.

Normalcy bias: a mental state people enter when facing a disaster which causes people to underestimate both the possibility of a disaster and its possible effects. 

Now a lot of progressives are genuinely afraid of what the Trump years will bring. Many of these fears are completely detached from reality. Your echo chamber has you worked up over phantoms.
But while you battle windmills on the internet,
you are sleepwalking headlong into **real** danger.

Given the trends that developed during the Obama administration, It would be fairly safe to assume that we will see some flashpoint that sets off civil unrest during the Trump administration. It would also be safe to assume, based on what we've seen so far, that progressives will encourage this unrest and do everything in their power to extend and amplify it. If one of these flash points gathers momentum we could expect something on the scale of Occupy, but with a more aggressive edge.

In the early stages these crowds will feel empowered, and many will believe that they are on the cusp of a revolution. That sentiment, however, will be short lived.

The left will be approaching these protests with a set of assumptions that formed while their party was in power, but the playing field under Trump isn't going to be the same AT ALL.

While Obama was unwilling to use his power to address the grievances that drove Occupy, it was clearly not in his interest to play hardball with the protesters. He adopted a strategy of looking the other way and letting the police do the dirty work. In short Obama was a passive (or passive aggressive) observer. Trump will not be.

**In the years following Occupy the echo chamber effect prevented progressives from realizing
that the content and delivery of social justice orthodoxy,
was alienating a growing percentage of the population, which was in turn being drawn into a counter narrative being pushed by what some have referred to as the "alt-right".**

This counter narrative was strengthened each time [the left refused to acknowledge evidence](http://www.dailywire.com/news/8362/milwaukee-pd-officer-who-shot-armed-black-man-was-james-barrett) that didn't match their preconceived storyline. By ignoring significant facts that should have informed the response, and by glossing over and justifying acts of violence and vandalism that were clearly out of line, the left enabled the alt-right to frame the rioting as opportunistic lawlessness. 

In parallel, the open contempt being expressed towards police began to backfire. Media outlets who had previously focused on police brutality began to side with law enforcement by default and to demonize the protesters. This trend was led by the Drudge Report, Infowars.com, and Breitbart news, and was mimicked across the conservative blogosphere.

Donald Trump coopted this narrative to win the presidency, labeling himself the "law and order" candidate. He went on to consolidate his commitment to that train of thought by hiring Steve Bannon, the CEO of Breitbart news as his chief strategist. That narrative will demand that Trump aggressively crush any riots or civil unrest that break out. Failure to do so would be framed as a betrayal, and would alienate his base.

Furthermore, the police and military in the United States are **extremely** conservative, and they overwhelmingly support Trump. They also have a great deal of pent up disdain for progressives. Trump wouldn't have to push them. All he would have to do is loosen their leash just a little bit and a very unpleasant chain of events would unfold.

If one of these flash points happens to be racially charged, this escalation [will be even more dangerous.](http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/trump-s-victory-has-fearful-minorities-buying-guns-n686881)

If protests turn violent, progressives will be expecting a crack down, but they will not be prepared for the scale or the brutality of it. This would be an unapologetic and unrestrained application of state force beyond anything our generation has ever seen. It would also be like throwing gasoline on a fire. These kinds of things have a way of spinning out of control, and Trump would be very tempted to abuse the powers given to him by the Bush and Obama administrations.

The moment such abuses begin will be a crucial inflection point. Public opinion will be hanging in the balance and the outcome will hinge on the ability to reach the hearts and minds of the very people that progressives have spent years mocking, insulting and shouting down. If it appears that social justice warriors were the instigators and if any of the resistance is armed the official narrative will be very hard to counter. 

And make no mistake armed resistance would fail, badly.

If the powers of the NDAA and the Patriot Act begin to be applied you're going to need help. You're going to need allies on the right; voices in the conservative and alternative media who have the ear of the police and military. You're going to need the libertarians, the constitutionalists and the conspiracy theorists. In short, you're going to need the support of the people you've come to hate.

The caustic, arrogant, condescending tone that the left has adopted while in power, and their complete inability to understand the real motives of their opponents are about to become serious liabilities.

Right now you have virtually no leaders or pundits who have any skill or experience influencing people they disagree with. In fact most don't even have the maturity to acknowledge that they have a problem. 

You're going to be starting from zero on multiple fronts, and if you don't make a monumental effort to change your habits right now, you're not going to be effective when it really counts.

This doesn't just apply to civil unrest. With Trump in the oval office, Republicans controlling both houses, and tipping the balance in the Supreme Court, new legislation and executive actions are not going to face any significant political obstacles. Some of these new laws are very likely to expand the police state powers established under Bush and Obama. And of course there is always the potential for new wars. On these issues you will have natural allies on the right, the question is whether you will build those alliances, or sabotage them early on.

To effectively reach those who disagree with you, one must build rapport, establish common ground and connect the other side's own beliefs and morality to a new narrative backed up by logic and evidence. In other words you have to learn to speak to them in their own language, and learning that language requires a different way of listening.

Start by intentionally following people and media outlets who you strongly disagree with. Listen until you can listen without reacting emotionally. Listen to them with the goal of actually understanding them, rather than searching for any and every point that you could attack them on. Start with the assumption that they have some pieces to the puzzle that you haven't encountered yet. Fact check their claims with an open mind, and when you find an issue where the logic and evidence turns out to be in their favor, embrace that new perspective and integrate it into your narrative. 

Seeking points of agreement and expanding upon them, gradually breaks down the us vs. them dynamic. 
It's only when you cease to be an enemy that they will be open to even listening to your opinions.

The artificial left right paradigm,
doesn't serve We the People. 
Never has, never will.

Divide and conquer, serves those at the top... 
of an artificial food chain.
It's a cozy little club of predators, 
and you're not in it.

You have a choice: a narrative that divides, or a narrative that unifies;
identity politics or shared principles.

And choose your leaders wisely.

Do they stand against ALL wars of aggression (covert, conventional or nuclear), no if ands or buts?
Do they stand against every police state power grab (by the blue team or red)?
Do they understand how debt based money, fractional reserve banking and the petrodollar,
enslaves us, locks us into an infinite growth paradigm, and holds us back as a species?

Maybe there's no one worth following.
Maybe it's your turn to play leader;
to tip the narrative,
and ripple the meme field.

The trajectory of history is a dice in midair.
And sometimes a ripple becomes a wave.
