People often contact me to let me know that a video that I created has been "stolen" or "ripped off" by someone, sometimes without attributing the source. This page represents my long standing position on the issue.

All of my content is released as [Creative Commons Attribution No Derivatives](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/). This means that if you are going to post my content I **prefer** that you post it in its entirety (not edited or mixed into another work), and provide attribution in the form of a link. I view this in terms of respect, not legality.

No one can own an idea. The entire concept of intellectual property is flawed and counter productive. The use of state and corporate coercion to restrict the flow and adaptation of information holds us back as a species.

In that context, my stance on the "No Derivatives" condition is more nuanced than the license implies. Sometimes my content is edited in ways that distorts the original meaning, or associates it with ideas and or personalities which I strongly oppose. Releasing under  "No Derivatives" is the only way reserve the **option** to address abuse. So far I have never exercised that option (I prefer to apply social pressure instead).

**IMPORTANT: You do NOT have the right to take a "Creative Commons Attribution No Derivatives" work and place copyright protections on it.** This is one area where I do take a hardline approach. Several times I have had people take the audio from my videos, mix it into their music, and then add that music to Youtube's content ID system. The result: my content got flagged (and claimed) for containing my own voice! Not cool. This license does not allow you to place restrictions on my content.

This license does not prevent you from using it in a commercial context (such as radio or television). However sometimes companies will demand to see written permission before you are allowed to monetize. This page constitutes written permission. Do not contact me for personalized documentation for Youtube copyright reviews. It wouldn't do any good anyway. Copyright enforcement on Youtube is highly political. I speak from experience.
