During times of upheaval history can turn on a dime, and often does.
The way we react, and or adapt to rapidly changing circumstances is often the determining variable. Our response is shaped by our world view, and our world view by the dominant cultural narrative (which in the age of instant, global communication is shifting faster than ever before).

These are treacherous waters, 
but believe it or not, I have hope;
hope that takes into account realities (and or probabilities)
that you may disturb you.

Some reading this page are looking for clues to determine who's side I am on.
Which team is he batting for? Blue team or red?

I'm not interested in partisan games.
The left/right paradigm doesn't serve We the People.
Divide and conquer makes you easy to control.

My loyalty is to those who stand against war,
debt based, banker controlled money,
and the expansion and abuse of police state powers,
<strong>REGARDLESS OF WHO IS IN OFFICE.</strong>

"How do I know I can trust you?" is a question I hear in various forms.

I don't ask you to trust me. 
My job is to collect evidence, 
connect it with logic,
and present it in a clear concise way.

**Ideas either stand on their own,
or they don't stand at all.**
The vector of transmission (aka the messenger) is irrelevant.
