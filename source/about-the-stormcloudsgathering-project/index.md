During times of upheaval history can turn on a dime, and often does.
The way we react, and or adapt to rapidly changing circumstances is often the determining variable. Our response is shaped by our world view, and our world view by the dominant cultural narrative (which in the age of instant, global communication is shifting faster than ever before).

These are treacherous waters, 
but believe it or not, I have hope;
hope that takes into account realities and probabilities
that you may disturb you.

Some will read this page looking for an out.
Enemy positions can be dismissed.
No need to consider the facts at hand.

"Which team is he batting for? Blue team or red?"

I don't play partisan games.
I don't buy into artificial group identities.
The left/right paradigm doesn't serve the people.
Never has, never will.

**Divide and conquer makes you easy to control.**

My loyalty is to those who stand against war,
debt based, banker controlled money,
and the expansion and abuse of police state powers,
<strong>REGARDLESS OF WHO IS IN OFFICE.</strong>

"How do I know I can trust you?" is a question I hear in various forms.

I don't ask you to trust me. <br />
My job is to collect evidence, connect it with logic, and present it in a clear, concise way.
If successful, the vector of transmission (aka the messenger) is rendered irrelevant.

**Ideas either stand on their own, or they don't stand at all.**
